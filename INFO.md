### Special Missions

Special Agency functions through the notion of missions. These can solidify into concrete acts, tools, situations that allow that special something of a special agent to come up and express themselves fully.

### Special Agents

Special Agency operates through a loose network of accomplices who can also act on their own.

One can be alone and still be a special agent for their own special agency, disregarding everything else. After all, human being's experience and perception are rich enough to allow for uninterrupted flow of information and the current state of technology allows one to be relatively independent from the rest.

A special agent can also find Accomplices in performing their mission: this will make some things easier.

**A list of Special Agents can be found in the "agents" folder.**
