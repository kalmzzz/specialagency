Special Agency
=============

####Everybody is special and everyone is an agent.####

There is even no other choice. One cannot refuse the fact that they are unlike anyone else – this is what's "special". One also cannot refuse the fact that they belong to the universe (or that it belongs to them) – this is the "agency". 

####The role of the Special Agency is to act as an interface that connects special agents in their speciality.####

It is an open source methodology that involves discipline, time management, organizational management as well as  various practices of mind expansion, such as polysingularity, network analysis, Systema, Noguchi taiso, intuitive approach and many more.

Special Agency attempts to affect both normality and the very notion of it.  

Every Special Agent acts within the frame which is constantly questioned, expanded, and morphed into poly-orthogonal shapes, which gain their own frequency, rhythmicality, physicality, emotional hues, and variable dynamics. In that Special Agent channels the very unique thing that is only him/her/its and nobody else’s – the natural lifeflow that was mysteriously obfuscated by one’s personality. 

It’s the remainings and artefacts of those obfuscations which are of interest to a Special Agent, as they are forming the building blocks and energy packets within physical matter – such as this book, the retina of the one who’s reading, the neuronal signal of the one who’s writing, the tremble within the air produced by somebody who speaks, sensations of somebody who touches.

In the end, Special Agency is an open source way of thinking, a certain methodology of proceeding beyond the limits imposed by any external context, authority, market or institution. It is a way of finding oneself from within and allowing it to fully express itself towards the outside in order to live, transform, and evolve.


### Special Missions

Special Agency functions through the notion of missions. These can solidify into concrete acts, tools, situations that allow that special something of a special agent to come up and express themselves fully.

**Network Thinking App – [InfraNodus](/missions/infranodus/)**
*Helps find new inspiration and connect ideas. Can be used in one's notes, thoughts, Twitter timelines, book and research excerpts and any other disjointed pieces of textual data.*

**Constructed Interactions - [The Waiting Room](/missions/waitingroom/)**
*A shared opportunity for one-on-one interaction.*

**Divinatory Guidance - [Divinatorium](/missions/divinatorium/)**
*A recommender system based on the best divination practices.*

**More missions can be found in the "missions" folder.**



### Special Agents

Special Agency operates through a loose network of accomplices who can also act on their own. 

One can be alone and still be a special agent for their own special agency, disregarding everything else. After all, human being's experience and perception are rich enough to allow for uninterrupted flow of information and the current state of technology allows one to be relatively independent from the rest. 

A special agent can also find Accomplices in performing their mission: this will make some things easier.

**A list of Special Agents can be found in the "agents" folder.**
