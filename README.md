Special Agency
=============

####Everybody is special and everyone is an agent.####

Every human being is special even if just because they are unlike anyone else – hence, the "special".

Every human being acts in the world – hence, the "agency".

So even if you don't yet know it, you are a part of a Special Agency. Any Special Agency.

####The role of the Special Agency is to act as an interface that helps link Special Agents in their speciality.####

There are at least as many Special Agencies around the world as there are people, but there can be even more. This particular one was created to encourage collaboration between Special Agents.

Special Agency is an open source way of thinking, a certain methodology of proceeding beyond the limits imposed by any external context, authority, market or institution. It is a way of finding oneself from within and allowing it to fully express itself towards the outside in order to live, transform, and evolve.

Every Special Agent acts within the frame which is constantly questioned, expanded, and morphed into poly-orthogonal shapes, which gain their own frequency, rhythmicality, physicality, emotional hues, and variable dynamics. In that Special Agent channels the very unique thing that is only him/her/its and nobody else’s – the natural lifeflow that was mysteriously obfuscated by one’s personality.

It’s the remainings and artefacts of those obfuscations which are of interest to a Special Agent, as they are forming the building blocks and energy packets within the physical matter – such as this screen, the retina of the one who’s reading, the neuronal signal of the one who’s writing, the tremble within the air produced by somebody who speaks, sensations of somebody who touches.

This description in itself can be modified and forked (transformed into something else) but anybody.


###Disclaimer and License

This is an open-source project licensed under Public Domain, which means anyone can copy it, modify it, appropriate it, and make something else with it.

If you found your name in the list of the Special Agents and you did not add it, then somebody else did.

In most cases that means that somebody finds you special and wants to connect you to other people, agencies, practices and projects that are special.

If you don't agree with that, feel free to remove your name. This is an open repository, so you can just send a so-called "push" request with the changes and it will be automatically updated.

In case you're not familiar with technicalities of open-source programming, just send an email to remove@specialagency.me and we will ask some other Special Agent to do it for you.
